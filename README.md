# Linux Build Project

This project is based on [Michiel Derhaeg's tutorial](https://github.com/MichielDerhaeg/build-linux) for building a minimal Linux system from scratch.

## Structure

- `doc/` - Documentation
- `filesystem/` - Base Linux file system
- `Makefile` - Automates the build
- `gen_image.sh` - Script to generate the final Linux image

## Usage

To build the system:
```bash
make
